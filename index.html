		<h2>About Grumpy Cat</h2>
		<p>Grumpy Cat was a cute little girl cat that always looked pissed off and fed up. Her facial features were the result of a condition called dwarfism. Her actual name was Tardar Sauce.</p>

		<!-- Why I love -->
		<h2>Why I love grumpy-looking cats</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>they seem to hate everybody, which is fun</li>
			<li>they are so small yet they seem so superior (which they are, of course)</li>
			<li>their disapproving little faces form a delightful contrast with their cute furry bodies</li>
			<li>have you seen the manul cat (or Pallas's cat)?</li>
		</ol>

		<!-- Other cats -->
		<h2>Other grumpy-looking cats</h2>
		<p>There are many more cats with angry facial features. Ever since Grumpy Cat died the world has been looking for a new icon, but so far none of the contestants have proven to be worthy successors. I recommend you watch videos of Pallas's cats (kittens and adults) on the web until a new bold cat leader has risen. Click on the links below to see more grumpy cats:</p>
